# wreq-js

A modern, actively maintained HTTP client that makes your scripts behave like real browsers on the network layer.

## Why wreq-js?

Standard HTTP clients like `axios`, `fetch`, `got`, and `curl` don't behave like browsers on the network layer. They differ in:

- **TLS handshake**: cipher suite order and extension sets
- **HTTP/2 frames**: SETTINGS and PRIORITY behavior
- **Header ordering**: the order headers are sent on the wire

Some anti-bot and fraud systems use these signals to flag non-browser clients.

`wreq-js` reproduces browser networking behavior using the [`wreq`](https://github.com/0x676e67/wreq) Rust engine underneath. Your job is to write scripts. wreq-js handles the network-level impersonation.

## When to use wreq-js

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="✅ Great for" icon="check">
    - Web scraping and data collection
    - API automation with stealth requirements
    - High-throughput HTTP requests
    - Login flows and session management
    - Proxy rotation scenarios
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="❌ Not for" icon="xmark">
    - DOM or JavaScript execution (not a browser runtime)
    - CAPTCHA solving or page automation
    - Full browser automation (use Playwright/Puppeteer instead)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Quick Example

<Note>
If your script makes more than one request, start with a **session** and reuse it.
Sessions reuse cookies and connection state, and are usually much faster than repeated one-off `fetch()` calls.
</Note>

```typescript
import { fetch } from 'wreq-js';

const response = await fetch('https://example.com/api', {
  browser: 'chrome_142',
  os: 'windows',
});

console.log(await response.json());
```

That is it. You get browser impersonation with a familiar, fetch-like API.
